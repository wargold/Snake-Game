# INDA-Snake
#### Authors: War Ahmed & Miro Bakovic

##### Project Description
We've all played the famous game Snake on our old Nokias. Similarly, a lot
of us have spent time, too much time, playing the evil sounding Achtung Die Kurve. With this project, we aim to combine the best of these games, into one single
game with the same ability to piss off players as flappy bird. The game will be
written in Java and the user will play using the keyboard arrows.

To make it as easy as possible for the end-user, we will write a short terminal-script that automatically compiles and runs the game. Of course, the user will
have to install Java. If Java is not installed, we will simply redirect the user towards an installation guide for Java.

Mainly, we want to make sure the GUI behaves as the user directs. When playing
the game itself, we want to make sure that a specific arrow-command moves the
Snake in the right direction. We will use coordinates to make sure of this when
testing.   

The newest version of the game is in the directory src, in order to run the game, compile and run the Game.java file. To start the game hit the Enter button from the main menu, the Snake will be moved with the arrow keys.

_This Snake game was developet during our second semester for the course, [DD1349](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD1349?l=en) Project in Introduction to Computer Science._
